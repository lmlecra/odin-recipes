        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Quesillo is a Venezualan Flan. It uses both the egg yolk and the egg white so it will have a prominent texture compared to the smooth and silky texture of the normal Leche Flan.</p>

        <p>. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounce) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li><em>~optional~</em>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <p>. </p>
        <p>. </p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F or 175°C.</li>
            <li>Prepare a water bath, by filling a 9-inch heat-proof container with water.</li>
            <li>Melt sugar in a nonstick pan over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until melted, 7 to 10 minutes; be careful to keep it from burning. Pour sugar into a flan mold, coating the sides to ensure that the egg/milk mixture in the next step will not touch the container.</li>
            <li>Pour sweetened condensed milk into a bowl. Fill the empty can with milk and add to the bowl; stir in eggs and vanilla extract. Blend well. Fold mixture with a spatula or tap against the counter to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Pour milk mixture into the slightly cooled flan mold. Put the lid on and place inside the water bath; don't let the water go over the rim.</li>
            <li>Bake the quesillo in the bain-marie in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Pry lid open with a knife carefully; continue baking until set, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Let quesillo cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes; refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Slide a knife around the edges of the mold to loosen and invert onto a plate.</li>
